# buffets

This is a Verilog implementation of Buffets.

Usage: 

**Simulate using VCS :** 
- `make all` (You may use `make all_gui` for GUI)

**To run different tests:**
- Open `buffet.f`
- Add the desired test from `./testbench/`
- `make all`


Note: This implementation focuses on depicting the interfaces and working principles rather than optimized implementation. We recommend replacing the register file with a SRAM from a RAM generator.
